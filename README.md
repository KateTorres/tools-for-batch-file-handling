# batch and bash files that I use for routine file handling

## List of files: 
 - **rename_windows_files** - copy this file to your **Windows** directory and run it to batch-rename files by changing variable "PATTERN=___" to whatever you want to remove from all files in a given directory. Edit the file in a text editor and replace ___ with your own text. Files in sub-directories will not be renamed.

- **combine_windows_file_contents** - copy this file to your **Windows** directory and run it to collect all text-like content into a single text file.
